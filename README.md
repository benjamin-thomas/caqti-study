This repository contains OCaml examples using the [Caqti][] library.  It is
meant to be checked out and used for learning.

This is currently work in progress.

## What we will be building

We will learn to handle this mildly complex relationship with `Caqti` and `PostgreSQL`:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    AUTHOR one to one or many BIBLIOGRAPHY : ""
    AUTHOR {
        int id PK
        string first_name "NOT NULL"
        string middle_name "NULL"
        string last_name "NOT NULL"
    }
    BOOK one to one or many BIBLIOGRAPHY : ""
    BOOK {
        int id PK
        string title "NOT NULL"
        string description "NOT NULL"
        string isbn "NOT NULL UNIQUE"
        date published_on "NOT NULL"
    }
    BIBLIOGRAPHY {
        int author_id FK
        int book_id FK
    }
```

- an author can publish one or many books
- a book can be written by one or many authors


## General overview

We will also:

- interact with the system via the `utop` REPL
- run a binary that will call into a lib to generate (and display) CRUD queries
- implement tests to ensure we always have a working system
- explain general OCaml-specific concepts along the way
  - the goal is to give a friendly introduction to an OCaml beginner
  - but we expect you to already be a programmer
  - we expect you to know SQL


## Goals

- learn to use `caqti` with a single connection (no concurrency)
- learn to use `caqti` with [lwt](https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt)
- learn to use `caqti` with [async](https://github.com/janestreet/async)
- learn to use `caqti` with [eio](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/eio)
- learn to use the satellite project [ppx_rapper](https://github.com/roddyyaga/ppx_rapper), which can be interesting from the perspective of reducing boilerplate

## Prerequisites

You must have a working installation of PostgreSQL.

Also, you should install the following dependencies:

```
opam install caqti

# Those are for testing
opam install base
opam install ppx_assert
opam install ppx_inline_test
```
