# Hello, World!

If you are getting started in OCaml, you'll have to understand how the tooling works to move along.

This basic examples explains the **basic** scaffolding we'll use from now on.

- `./lib/` : contains our application's logic.
- `./bin/` : start our app

```
cd ./00-hello-world

# Compile and run `main.ml`
dune exec ./bin/main.exe
```
